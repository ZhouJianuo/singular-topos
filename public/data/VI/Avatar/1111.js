I don't like it that much.\"</i><br><br><i>\"Mmm... finally got an honest answer out of you. So, if the Underworld no longer needs Wildfire's protection... would you still train yourself as a fighter?\"</i><br><br><i>\"Mmm, lemme think... I probably will.\"</i><br><br><i>\"Why? You didn't get into fighting because you want the golden belt. Don't think you can hide that from me. If the Underworld really became peaceful one day... would you still have a reason to fight?\"</i><br><br><i>\"Sir, I remember you saying that there are bad people in every era. Even if all the Fragmentum monsters die off, people would still fight to the death for every little thing.\"</i><br><br><i>\"Hmm... I did say that.\"</i><br><br><i>\"As long as there are still bad people in this world, and as long as there are still good people I need to protect‚Äî\"</i> Luka stands up, <i>\"then I will keep on fighting!\"</i>"
