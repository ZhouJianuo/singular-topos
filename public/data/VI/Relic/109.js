Most of these fans could not afford the costly fees for an escape, so accepting their fate and waiting for the electromagnetic burst to arrive was their only option. Ever since witnessing the return of these rebellious youths to the planet, they had felt it in their bones that their souls were ignited at this very moment. Onto these wristbands they wrote their lyrics, their showtime, as well as the band's unvoiced scream.<br><br>Sid the bassist collected the wristbands for every tour.

There they sang about the tragedy of planetary destruction, which echoed throughout the entire universe.<br><br>David printed the back of his leather jacket with a white star, or, more accurately, the white dwarf their star would become after the collapse. This would be their star's proof of existence. Those who left the planetary system and those who stayed behind all listened to that thunder-like rock 'n' roll and brandished the same striking symbol.<br><br>Despite ceasing to exist, their presence had been remixed into the music and carved into eternity.<br><br>\"We'll burn with our life, 'cause the white star needs a spark to ignite.\" From \"White Star,\" a single from Sizzling Thunder's final album of the same name.

Sparks leaped under Bonham's boots. The entire band merged with thunder and lightning. After the encore, a huge ball of lightning engulfed the stage and announced the end of Sizzling Thunder's show.<br><br>After the night of their twilight show, Sizzling Thunder came to a permanent end, just like in their lyrics.<br><br>\"Thunderclaps drown out our voice, lightning runs through our veins. We'll perish with our music and our star.\" From \"Song of Sizzling Thunder,\" a single from Sizzling Thunder's final album, Bonham's masterpiece.",
