There are two outcomes: To temporarily transfer the Crane Feather Orbit Fleet of the Xianzhou Yaoqing, or to draw from the manpower of the Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet of the Fanghu. Only one choice can be made. To use the Crane Feather Orbit Fleet means being able to press a strong offense for some time but losing any hope of victory thereafter. To use the Ebony Pearl Orbit Fleet, we must endure the vast distances between us and the Fanghu and have the conflict drag on for six months.

Divination can provide counsel and guidance, but only the general can make the final decision. He chose the path that would lead to the smallest loss. This didn't invalidate my divination, of course — defeat was the predetermined outcome.\"</i><br><br><i>\"The treatises on the art of war state that an advantage in numbers speaks favorably for initiating battle, and calling on the aid of Yaoqing's forces may not be the worst possible decision. Moreover, nothing is ever certain in this world. How can you be so sure, master diviner? How can you speak as if all have been predestined?\"</i><br><br><i>\"Nothing is ever certain in this world?\"</i> The man sighed heavily. <i>\"I thought the same thing when the divination results appeared...

            "Story": "Centuries passed thus, and the flames of war descended again. Diviner Fu Xuan calculated ceaselessly at her job. The grand armies of the Denizens of Abundance formed for the third time and launched a surprise attack on the Xianzhou Fanghu. The Yuque and the Luofu were close to the Fanghu, and it was their duty to give assistance. The divination revealed that all Xianzhou armies will meet a devastating defeat if they choose to face the assault head-on — however, should they keep up a defense, then there will be a chance to change the tides of battle.<br><br>What a pity that the hexagram did not reveal how this chance will come about! Fu Xuan calculated and divined over and over again, yet the results given by the Matrix of Prescience never changed.<br><br><i>\"No one will choose defeat.\"</i> This was the limit of a diviner's capacities. Fu Xuan outlined the pros and cons in writing and submitted the divination results to the Seat of Divine Foresight. However, as she expected, the outcome of the meeting between the Arbiter-Generals concluded that they must not take on a defensive position, not when such overwhelming numbers of the Abundance Axis were assaulting the Fanghu. The Cloud Knights of the Luofu and the Yuque must rise to face the enemy, buying time before the Yaoqing's army can arrive.<br><br>On that day, Fu Xuan bore witness through the Projection Sandpit to the Alliance's army being decimated. Not only did the borisin bring fleets and mechabeasts numerous enough to block out the sky, they even summoned the incarnosphere Ketu Mirage from ancient legends. This evil gravitated toward the Fanghu, hellbent on bringing annihilation to all lives onboard, recreating the tragedy of the fall of the Xianzhou Cangcheng. And the only thing people could do was watch as it neared.<br><br>Was this truly the limit of a diviner's capacities!? A bold idea surfaced in Fu Xuan's mind as she drowned in anxiety and anger. <i>\"I must see General Jing Yuan!\"</i><br><br>The girl spoke her thoughts when brought face-to-face with the general. It was no longer possible to obtain victory with the forces available to the Cloud Knights. The only chance of victory lies in making the Reignbow manifest themselves.<br><br>She was not expecting the tired-looking man before her to simply nod after hearing her absurd and borderline blasphemous idea. The general did not even show any hints of ridicule. <i>\"How would you want to do it?\"</i><br><br><i>\"The Xianzhou Yuque holds the Cloudpeer Telescope, the ultimate astronomical observation device in the Alliance. Not only can it scry into the distance, it can also be used to send out information... I plan to ship the Cloudpeer Telescope to the Fanghu using a Navis Astriger, and send out an SOS signal to the last observed location of the Reignbow's Lux Arrow. If we hurry, we still have a chance to turn everything around before that living planet falls.\"</i><br><br><i>\"I trust that you are... well aware of the singular sign of the Reignbow's descent onto the physical plane and its consequences, correct?\"</i><br><br><i>\"Yes. As the person who voiced this plan, I am willing to be on the front lines and execute it.\"</i> The girl's expression was solemn. She was keenly aware of how unorthodox her idea was.<br><br><i>\"I thank you for your words, but the Six Charioteers should work together to combat such a great crisis. Moreover, you do not have the permission to manipulate that device. Should this plan go awry, I will take all responsibility as the one who made the suggestion. Do not trouble yourself over this, Miss Fu.\"</i><br><br>As Fu Xuan watched the general's retreating figure, she suddenly realized what he meant by \"the Six Charioteers should work together\" — the only person who has the permission to use the Cloudpeer Telescope and can send out a signal in the format of the Reignbow's decree...<br><br>...was none other than the Yuque's Master Diviner.<br><br>...<br><br><i>\"Is this why you seek \"The Eye\"? I saw your dreams...\"</i><br><br>The girl did not open her eyes, yet she could already see the world around her condense into solid form from nebulous mist, see all possibilities fade and leave behind the solitary, absolute, and faultless \"choice.\"<br><br><i>\"Those are not dreams. They are my past. They made me who I am.\"</i><br><i>\"And he was right all this time. There is only ever one path in destiny.\"</i>"

She has not grown. This is not unusual as slow development is common among Vidyadhara. I am more concerned about her having no dreams than the slow growth of her body.<br><br>All past high elders, after receiving the \"Orb of Abysm\" and the \"Transmutation Arcanum,\" will re-experience the events of their dragon ancestors' lives in dreams. The Office of Deep Sources is charged with transcribing, retelling, and annotating these dreams, and their files run to an enormous number of volumes. Although such dreams tend to be fragmentary and difficult to understand or interpret, it is after all the only way our kind have of coming close to Permanence. Yet Lady Bailu has experienced nothing of this sort. It is apparent that either her dragon heart is in some way damaged, or the \"Transmutation Arcanum\" has not been carried through in full.<br><br>Furthermore, since the high elder has already demonstrated her powers of calling lightning and commanding the waters, I have instructed one of our finest crafters to make the Dragonhorn Pilory to shackle her tail, to prevent a loss of control over her powers and a repeat of the disaster of the Sedition of Imbibitor Lunae.<br><br>Also, we received a missive from Caelorum Venti of the Yaoqing some months ago, inquiring into the present condition of Lady Bailu. I have replied as you instructed, esteemed elders. The gist of my reply was that Lady Bailu is still young and in need of the assistance of the Preceptors.

At this moment, she was just an insignificant fruit upon this giant tree, powerless against mighty roots.<br><br>A colossal, blazing sword plunged down from the heavens, scorching away the sweet yet putrid atmosphere. A towering figure in formidable armor crashed onto the battlefield like a meteor, bellowing at the towering tree. The strange tree blossomed once more like a perennial flower, its golden branches growing ferociously to tightly entangle the enemy.<br><br><i>\"Each time you overcome death, I am beyond overjoyed. Like them, your flesh and blood are insignificant, but your pain is something that pleases me.\"</i><br><br>The branches laughed shrilly, letting each head speak one word on their behalf, stringing together a sentence, <i>\"Teng Xiao, what do you plan on using to kill me this time? I'm curious.\"</i><br><br><i>\"With myself.\"</i> The man replies calmly. Behind him, the golden illusion plunges the colossal blade straight down into the ground from high up in the sky.<br><br><i>\"Sister... sister!\"</i><br><br>The cries grow more urgent. She could feel herself being once again filtered, deleted, merged, and stuffed into a narrow and limited self.<br><br><i>\"These so-called Judges of the Netherworld and envoys of the Ten Lords truly amount to nothing.\"</i><br><br>Like everyone who jolts awake from a dream, she returns to her body but has forgotten the momentary dream.

He rolls around on the ground in excruciating pain, finally losing consciousness and going limp like a puddle of goo.<br><br><i>\"You say I am a tool that sheds no blood and cries no tears?\"</i> The judge, now dressed in a bloodstained robe, slowly rises from the massive body of the criminal. <i>\"It's Abominations of Abundance like you... that have shattered my sympathy.\"</i><br><br>She tries her best to push her skull, spine, and patella back to the correct positions, then fastens to her waist the severed arm that cannot be re-attached no matter what.<br><br>What will her sister and Huohuo say about this time?

To fill this void, I personally visited Professor Rond, who had a significant influence on Ratio's upbringing.

The undergraduates in my class struggled to even comprehend the concepts. Out of curiosity, I shared a manuscript about an equation named Rond's Conjecture in private. Although I'm the one who proposed the equation, I've been unable to prove it. After days of discussion, Ratio came up with a brilliant and stunning idea that managed to finally prove the equation in one strike. The paper will be published shortly, and you will see that I am speaking the truth.<br><br>Ratio showed remarkable perception, curiosity, and creativity during the time we spent together. He wakes up early every morning to exercise before diving straight into the sea of knowledge afterward. Perhaps, he is exactly what everyone would picture a genius to be — passionate, profound, fervent, and inherently dominating.<br><br>Due to the lack of more advanced science programs at local schools, I sincerely hope that your esteemed institution will accept Ratio's enrollment. I can vouch for him on my reputation that he will definitely achieve accomplishments that transcend this era and bring glory to your widely-renowned institution.<br><br>Best wishes,<br>Rond<br>██ ██ ██, Philosopher Calendar\"</i><br><br>Extracted from page 9, <i>Wisdom as a Privilege: Decoding Dr. Ratio</i>"

The fact that Ratio calls himself a Mundanite seems to affirm the rumor. It is hard not to read something into the organization's name, given Ratio's entangled history with the Genius Society.
