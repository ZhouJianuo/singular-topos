At that time, she had no idea how to reply, so she brushed the inquiry off like a joke.<br><br>However, after that, Lynx also began to think about this question over and over again herself. Was she truly interested in ancient Belobogian history or geography? Or did she actually want to avoid socializing in a city trapped in eternal winter? Or...<br><br>Or perhaps the girl didn't even realize that, to Lynx, the way Landaus do things is pretty simple.<br><br><i>\"If you want to do something, go for it.\"</i><br><br>Serval was obsessed with machinery and music, so she ran the workshop and became a rock musician. Gepard wanted to protect Belobog, so he became a Silvermane Guard captain.<br><br>Therefore, when Lynx suddenly announced to the family: <i>\"I want to venture deep into the Snow Plains,\"</i> it was also simple as that.<br><br>Afraid of the cold? Then wear something warm. Afraid of the danger? Then learn survival skills. No one's done it before? Then Lynx can be the first one.<br><br><i>\"After all, isn't it simple to just go from start to goal's end?\"</i>"
