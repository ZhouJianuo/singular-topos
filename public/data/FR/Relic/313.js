            "Name": "Recliner of the Sigonian Mother-Goddess",
            "Desc": "Sealed within this plane is the most habitable zone in Sigonia-IV — The desolate barren desert known as the Mother Goddess' Recliner. The silent and unassuming Gaiathra Triclops is silent and unadorned, and HER immense and heavy torso quietly encompasses all the living and deceased in Sigonia.",
            "Story": "When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic addressed three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras despite the bitter cold, pestilence, and death that enveloped those conundrums. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of endless difficulties and strife.<br><br>Situated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.<br><br>In reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.<br><br>They share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"skinning knife,\" symbolizing the most savage and barbarous clan among Sigonians. On the other hand, \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" and they are often accused of being thieves by those stubborn or pedantic. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, performing a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. From there, Sigonians were briefly united under the radiance of Amber, and the natural cycles that were finally reached a temporary conclusion.<br><br>Afterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the civilized universe.<br><br>Unfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Some malicious opportunists among the Sigonians harbored fear regarding the former's resourcefulness and cunning while slandering the latter as nothing more than cannibalistic beasts. Although they possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, these malicious and corrupt individuals banished both clans to the endless desert.<br><br>As a token of apology, they affirmed that \"the Avgins would eternally retain the right of autonomy\" — In other words, they could legitimately and lawfully remain silent when the two peoples turn upon each other in fire and conflict.",

            "Name": "Sigonia's Knot of Cyclicality",
            "Desc": "Sigonian calameteorites are meticulously polished and shaped, then strung together with gold threads and viridescent silk by the Avgins. They believe that these protective knots must not be buried in the sand, but should radiate like the Mother Goddess' divine body reborn from death on the night of Kakava.",
            "Story": "\"Avgin\" means \"honey\" in the Sigonian language. This is a commonplace term completely lost in the long arc of cosmic history.<br><br>This perception is not entirely baseless, as the Avgins possess naturally appealing features, captivating eyes, and inherently exceptional emotional intelligence, enabling them to easily win the favor of strangers. However, these inborn talents are the exact reason they draw jealousy and ire from others. The envious and snobbish began their ceaseless slander, and the condemnation of the Avgins spread like wildfire. As rumors are sufficient to tarnish the sanctity of truth, the Avgins, a people of a border world, found themselves assailed without recourse, able to only endure all manner of prejudice in silence.<br><br>The Avgins exhibit a particular fondness for intricately patterned fabrics and are drawn to jewelry crafted from precious jade, with a special affinity for Sigonian Calameteorite. This gemstone is the only one capable of rivaling the resplendent divine body of Gaiathra Triclops in their mythology, who is believed to have been reborn from death.<br><br>Known as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray HER as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for HER through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for HER would only create distance from HER protective embrace.<br><br>The Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, HER divine body will perish.<br><br>On that significant day, HER divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.<br><br>According to the incident report from the Marketing Development Department, the moment of astonishing resistance occurred on the night of Kakava. Despite stormy winds and cloud-covered skies that swallowed up the light of the celestial auroras, the Avgins were more excited than ever even though such sights should generally regarded as ill omens. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.<br><br>\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. SHE is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"<br>\"This rain will be accompanying us eternally and protecting us. We shall meet our honorable demise in the rain.\"",
