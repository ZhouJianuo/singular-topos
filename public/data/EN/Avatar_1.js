The silent and unassuming Gaiathra Triclops is silent and unadorned, and her immense and heavy torso quietly encompasses all the living and deceased in Sigonia.",
                "Story": "When discussing Oswaldo Schneider, the head of the IPC's Marketing Development Department, people often focus on the decisive operations he undertook upon assuming the position. Within just two years, this young fanatic addressed three major longstanding issues that had plagued the Department for several Amber Eras despite the bitter cold, pestilence, and death that enveloped those conundrums. One of these challenges is the desolate planet known as Sigonia-IV, which is covered in barren deserts and scarred by clan vendettas... a place of endless difficulties and strife.<br><br>Situated near the convergence of three major star clusters, Sigonia-IV has long been subjected to stellar winds from multiple stars, earning its reputation as the \"eye of the storm\" throughout the Cosmos. The planet's surface environment is extremely harsh, leading many civilizations to either migrate to other celestial bodies or succumb to natural disasters. Now, only a small number of intelligent races remain there, referred to as Sigonians by scholars from the Intelligentsia Guild.<br><br>In reality, Sigonians have fragmented into numerous clans, with most adopting nomadic lifestyles, while a few have established centralized systems of governance of reasonable size.<br><br>They share a common language. Through the translation provided by the Synesthesia Beacon, you will learn that \"Katica\" means \"skinning knife,\" symbolizing the most savage and barbarous clan among Sigonians. On the other hand, \"Avgin\" means \"honey,\" representing the most notorious and despicable thieves among the clans. These clans share a vendetta that lasted through Amber Eras, performing a cycle of bloody vengeance in the boundless wilderness where only the fittest survive — Until mysterious figures clad in black descended from the sky. The Avgins, being the prey, received the Amber's protection, and the unending killing game finally reached a temporary ceasefire.<br><br>Afterward, under the IPC's guidance, the Sigonians established the Sigonian Sovereignty according to the Interstellar Peace Charter and took their first steps toward the civilized universe.<br><br>Unfortunately, this unity and progress did not extend to the Avgins and Katicans. Sigonians harbored fear regarding the former's resourcefulness and cunning while considering the latter to be nothing more than cannibalistic beasts. Although Sigonians possessed only limited knowledge about Preservation, they understood that some of them had to be sacrificed for it. Utilizing a highly advanced set of parliamentary rules, the chiefs banished both clans to the endless desert.<br><br>As a token of apology, they affirmed that \"the Avgins would eternally retain the right of autonomy\" — In other words, they could legitimately and lawfully remain silent when the Katicans' butcher knives were ever turned against the Avgins once more in the future.",

                "Story": "\"Avgin\" means \"honey\" in the Sigonian language. This is a commonplace derogatory term emphasizing the astute, persuasive, and capricious nature of the Avgins.<br><br>This perception is not entirely baseless, as the Avgins possess naturally appealing features, captivating eyes, and exceptional emotional intelligence borderline that of sorcery, enabling them to easily win the favor of strangers. This inborn talent helps them to navigate between major clans and ethnic groups, effortlessly obtaining whatever they desire — though mostly resorting to less-than-legal means. Nowadays, the Avgins has gained notoriety throughout the entire universe as smugglers, stowaways, swindlers, gamblers, thieves, robbers, and occasional social butterflies.<br><br>The Avgins exhibit a particular fondness for intricately patterned fabrics and are drawn to jewelry crafted from precious jade, with a special affinity for Sigonian Calameteorite. This gemstone is the only one capable of rivaling the resplendent divine body of Gaiathra Triclops in their mythology, who is believed to have been reborn from death.<br><br>Known as Fenge Biyos, their Mother Goddess reigns over all matters related to fertility, travels, and trickery. Depictions of the Mother Goddess in the Avgins' religion often portray her as a left palm adorned with three eyes. The Avgins primarily express reverence for her through spoken prayers alone, believing that the Mother Goddess is as silent and unassuming as the mountains of Sigonia, and that crafting statues or composing hymns for her would only create distance from her protective embrace.<br><br>The Avgins view the world through the body of the Mother Goddess — the earth, the mountains, and all that exists on the land are a part of the Mother Goddess' divine body. And at the end of each calendar year, her divine body will perish.<br><br>On that significant day, her divine essence ascends as a resplendent aurora in the night sky and is reborn in the following day. Hence, Avgins celebrate the first day of the new year through their grand festival called \"Kakava.\" During this festival, they weave sacrificial vessels known as \"Knots of Cyclicality\" and toss them into bonfires to commemorate the Great Goddess' birth.<br><br>According to the incident report from the Marketing Development Department, the second tragedy that claimed the lives of the entire Avgin clan occurred on the night of Kakava. Despite stormy winds and cloud-covered skies that swallowed up the light of the celestial auroras, the Avgins were more excited than ever even though such sights should generally regarded as ill omens. When questioned about this, a maiden from the clan provided the following response.<br><br>\"Rain is a gift from the Mother Goddess. She is calling to us, urging us to take up arms and fight for our future.\"<br>\"This rain will be accompanying us eternally and protecting us. We shall meet our honorable demise in the rain.\"",

Guests from other lands defy gravity and walk on walls. Strange toys come to life and roam the streets in celebration. The water from the spring turn into a giant whale and swim through the halls. Opening a window no longer show a view of the stars in the deep sky, but of the city's shifting streams of light and shadows, holding up the constant echoes of giant clocks and theaters. The guests finally realize that they were never awake, but are instead witnessing Penacony's true nature in a dream — a place where time stops in a neverending dreamscape.<br><br>Everyone knows that, under the rule of \"The Family,\" the doors of Penacony are open to everyone amidst the stars. For a transcendent experience, for an inspirational excitement, for the soothing of worries and wounds — guests of the highest caliber come to surrender their pain in exchange for peace and tranquility, to drink the best of the best, and to wander in the sea of dreams. Some spend unforgettable holidays here and leave content, while others become obsessed with the festivities and settle down here. The star-studded hotel is the jewel of dream weavers, the kingdom of dream makers, and the playground of dream seekers.<br><br>Few guests are aware of the dusty history of the past — the thread that weaves the dreams comes from reality. The velvety splendor of today's Penacony was born of salty rust, heavy shackles, and deprived freedom. The Planet of Festivities was once an IPC prison, where countless inmates were relocated to salvage the overflowing Memory Bubbles for the Garden of Recollection. People repeated their endless toils until their bodies were as heavy as lead, but their souls became as light as bubbles. At some unknown point in time, the small cells cut off access to reality, but people's consciousnesses became linked in dreams. In the midnight bell, that shared dream seemed so real, reflecting the sheer hypocrisy of reality.<br><br>It lasted until the Destruction melted the chains of the IPC, the Trailblaze connected this frontier to the other stars, and the Harmony arrived upon invitation to sow the seeds of peace. Freedom finally broke ground and added a new name to the original dream — Penacony.<br><br>Today, there is no trace of the crumbling prison. In the dream world, a myriad of skyscrapers has been erected and the desert has been rebuilt and transformed into a metropolis — a new world for dreamers in search of wealth and opportunities, and a utopia for those in search of indulgence and pleasure. The past of the Planet of Festivities is like a photo that fell to the bottom of a cupboard — it exists, but is seen by no one.<br><br>Nowadays, the land of dreams is filled with songs of joy, and the noise of the past have been relegated to gossip, silently lost in the interlude of a comedy, in the behind-the-scenes of some cartoon, or in the side column of some magazine.",

The opulent hotel is just the tip of the iceberg of the Planet of Festivities, and it is only when you \"stay and dream\" that you are considered to have officially arrived at Penacony. From then on, the land of dreams, consisting of twelve dreamscapes, slowly expands before the guests' eyes.<br><br>Guests who are new to the place may be overwhelmed by this carnival stage, but do not be alarmed. Look up and see the metal tracks crisscrossing the skyscrapers and the Spheroids rapidly rolling along them. They are the most visible means of transportation in this dreamscape metropolis and guide guests to each and every place around the city.<br><br>Starting from the central station, the complicated Spheroid tracks are like the blood vessels of the metropolis. Whether it is the underground tunnels of the Moment of Daybreak, the vast fields of the Moment of Scorchsand, or the glittering stadium of the Moment of Stars, the colorful Spheroids roll on and on, delivering people to each station accurately, efficiently, safely, and comfortably, pouring a sleepless energy into the dream world of Penacony.<br><br>Dreams give a light and delicate texture to everything, and the nut-like Spheroids are regarded as both vehicles and as toys in the land of dreams. However, few remember that the Spheroids are actually imprisonment cages — the vehicle towards dreams are tools originally used for locking up prisoners.<br><br>A long time ago, the IPC sent a huge number of prisoners to the Asdana star system in an attempt to stop a catastrophe from spreading. There, people reclaimed memoria, gradually becoming lost between fantasy and reality. The spherical work chambers in vacuum became an unforgettable \"memory\" for the prisoners — the hard curved interior walls, the awful experience of tumbling around, the unbearable daily attendance — perhaps these pains ran too deep. When those who regained their freedom pioneered the barren dreamscape, the spherical cages came along with them.<br><br>But now, unlike in the past, peace and freedom have given birth to optimism. Instead of trying to destroy the inescapable nightmares over and over, it is better to add to them the color this place should have, to take them in, and embrace them. So, the spherical imprisonment cages of the past have become today's Spheroids.<br><br>In the present, the fast-moving colorful Spheroids moving all over Penacony and the slight reverberations coming from within them... are all quietly hidden in the light of the dream city, blending in with the ambitions and laughter, like a land of dreams where time forever stands still.",

Besieged by the monsters with compound eyes and sheathed wings, the cries of the people of Glamoth were drowned out by despair, and the Welkin Empire was shattered from then on.<br><br>Until one day knights clad in mechanical armor descended from the sky and wiped out the sun-swallowing Swarm. Since then, the silver-white iron knights have traveled to and from the various star systems in the empire, crossing the devastated territories and fighting back against the calamity that wiped out the galaxy. They were like warriors born to fight the Swarm. No one knew the faces lying beneath the masks of the Iron Calvary, but their arrival was like a gift from the gods, bringing the light of day back to the human world. Under the Empress' command, Glamoth's Iron Cavalry charged across the skies, finally stemming the tide of enemies and bringing a moment of respite to the empire.<br><br>But in the never-ending battle against their archenemy, the empire started becoming more and more like its adversary — more and more Iron Calvary flew high into the sky, blotting out the heavens just as the Swarm did on that fateful day. The look people cast on the Empress and the cavalry turned to one of fear, a fear akin to what they felt toward the Swarm. Perhaps one day the empire would attain the victory it so desired. But on that day, will Glamoth still be a paradise for humanity to rest in?<br><br>The Iron Cavalry Regiment formed the last line of defense at the border of Glamoth, where the battle raged on endlessly. Upon their warships, the silent knights bore a mission, carrying the hopes of the entire empire, and faced the tides of enemies drowning out the stars.",

As centuries passed and stars shifted in the sky, Thalassa became a trade partner of the Xianzhou Alliance. It was then that the aquatic people of Insumousu set foot inside the \"celestial palace\" for the first time. There, they beheld the complete grandeur of the Xianzhou, and at last learned the truth behind the Divine Fall.<br><br>The well-educated Insumousu gentry always regarded themselves as a continuation of the Daiyu. \"What the Daiyu once followed, we should follow. What the Daiyu once fought against, we should also fight.\" When they tell stories from the past, they would still begin with these words:<br><br>\"Once upon a time, the palace of the gods fell from the heavens.\"",

                "Story": "Vonwacq is a small and crowded planet, almost entirely covered by rainforests and islands, with its exuberant wildlife being its most recognizable feature.<br><br>Vonwacq's effervescent vitality made the rainforests near its equator grow so large and tall that their shades would cover the sky above and even block out the sun. The lack of sunlight in the undergrowth of the rainforest throughout the year creates a perfect space for fungi and other low-light plants to grow. Intelligent creatures inhabited regions near the tropics. Plants, irrespective of height, would grow naturally here. Fresh fruits and vegetables could be picked at any time and anywhere, which was what the locals mostly fed on.<br><br>However, be it the new immigrants or the indigenous Wacqwacq beings, they have always maintained a quasi-religious reverence for the animal fruits growing on the Thestang tree.<br><br>The great Thestang tree never stopped bearing fruit, not even for a moment. With time, all those yellowish and translucent oval-shaped fruits grew larger and heavier, hanging down from the branches until the stems could no longer bear their weight. When the time came, fruits would fall to the ground with a loud and crisp sound, cracking their thin skin and releasing whatever was held within. The fauna of Vonwacq was all born this way, be it fish, birds, or polar bears. On Planet Vonwacq, creatures of all kinds shared one common birth mother.<br><br>The fiend known as the \"Demon King\" was also born from one such fruit of the Thestang tree. From the moment of its birth, it instinctively knew how to swing its giant ax-like pincers toward others, waging war upon the entire biosphere of Vonwacq.<br><br>Every sixty natural years, the Thestang tree would give birth to a new demon king, and the cycle went on and on. The people of Vonwacq had long been used to and prepared for such cyclical fates of doom. Whenever a demon king's awakening approached, they would temporarily set aside their disputes and work together, assembling their strongest warriors to set sail for Wacq Island... One sixty years after another sixty years, these seemingly pointless crusades had been launched over and over again for hundreds of years in such narrow landscapes on this small planet. The demon kings were the permanent disaster of Vonwacq, and the caches of civilization were periodically wiped out.<br><br>Thus, it could be said that Planet Vonwacq was more like a stagnating pool of dead water, even though it was teeming with lively creatures that were ceaselessly fighting with each other, seemingly full of possibilities for change.",

Then these creatures awakened, cried, and subsequently left Wacq Island to seek a habitat of their own on Planet Vonwacq.<br><br>At first, the outsiders from the stars were seen as reckless thieves who, upon receiving a \"friendly\" tribal welcome, began to understand the civilizational dilemma of Vonwacq. Soon after, the outsiders boarded the locals' boats and sailed to Wacq Island, curious about how a demon king would be born from the fruit. The tribal warriors lay low on the shoals in trepidation, closely clenching their Stone Age weapons. To fight for sixty years of peace, they seemed determined, ready to make the ultimate sacrifice, one where they may never return home.<br><br>As the war went on, the outsiders discovered the truth about the \"Demon King\" — It was a species of interstellar worm that had once been considered extinct. It was simply unexpected that these creatures would appear in such a form in this corner of the universe.<br><br>When the brutal expedition was finally over, the surviving few natives left the coastline with news of their victory, while the curious outsiders quietly stayed behind. They pushed aside the drooping branches of the giant tree and sank into the quagmire, almost half-submerged. In the sunken lands of the rainforest, the outsiders found a control cabin. It was then that the secret of Vonwacq was finally revealed — the Thestang tree turned out to be the eco genesis system from a much higher civilization, which could decode and then release innumerable life forms to restore the planet's biosphere.<br><br>The demon king that cyclically rampaged the planet turned out to be just one single piece of data in the vast biologic database. The outsiders deleted the data of the demon king and then left Vonwacq, not seeking any credit or gratitude from the locals.<br><br>The sound of tidal waves battering against the seaside land was the only audible sound on the coastline of Wacq Island. The indigenous coalition forces of Vonwacq were all lined up and were convinced that the demon king would never come again. Then they cheered, toasted, sang, and talked all night about a future without demon kings. However, almost immediately after the two allied tribes bid farewell and returned to their respective homelands, the two tribes began plotting wars for their takeover of the whole of Vonwacq... Without a common threat such as the demon king, their alliance was but a non-binding piece of paper. The small planet was never designed to withstand a conflict between the two tribes. And the short-lived, fragile peace had since shattered out of existence.<br><br>The coastline of Wacq Island remained in its enigmatic calm as if nothing had ever transpired on these shores. With humans and Wacqwacq gone from its center stage, Vonwacq had finally reclaimed peace and completed its ecological restoration.",

The planet-destroying wars of the past brought mountains upon mountains of ruins and wreckage onto the surface of Talia, resulting in imperishable radiation and taking away the last remaining hope to sustain life. The thieves had nowhere else to go and fell into a cave beneath the surface of the planet, which turned out to be a tunnel left by the rodent race... The thieves managed a narrow escape, and their dream of establishing a Kingdom of Banditry was thus discreetly born in this lost realm of seclusion.<br><br>Innumerable caverns were interconnected in a massive labyrinth. More groups of thieves and bandits were lured in by this supposed dreamland meant for them and came to accumulate wealth and exchange technology, subsequently laying the foundation for the kingdom.<br><br>As more and more thieves and bandits settled down here, the once desolate planet became extraordinarily bustling with life. Thieves of great renown spoke of their ideal of a Kingdom of Banditry, promising to use the treasury to build a nation of equity and fairness. But as the amount of accumulated wealth grew larger and larger, the same thieves tore up their flimsy promises right away and attempted to monopolize all the wealth. Mercenaries, riots, double crossings, and betrayals... Chaos ensued one after another. Perhaps the initiators never even once believed in their ideal of so-called equity for all.<br><br>Henceforth, thieves who resented lofty ideals found themselves in a chaotic age where ignorance was glorified. They seized water sources to build towns of their own and mocked the very idea of fairness and justice.<br><br>Everyone in Nailscrap Town was a bandit. They drove violently destructive off-road vehicles and fought for resources with other hordes of bandits in the desert. They created mechanical armor and weapons out of scrap iron and old wires... The more barren the wasteland was, the more freedom they got out of it, like one final frenzy before doomsday. Those sweet dreams were like wisps of nonsense in the radiating heat waves and had long ceased to leave any trace behind.<br><br>In a half-awake trance, the thieves came to the realization that the Kingdom of Banditry was never about creation but about destruction.",

It had once been neatly lined up on a starship until one hasty escape attempt of the starship led to a huge shock wave, which subsequently exposed the wire to the moisture in the air.<br><br>The entire starship was dragged into a labyrinth of underground passages. On the thieves' starship, shields made of steel plates were removed layer by layer, and the power lines were crudely stripped apart, all of which were then used to build the first-ever alliance market. The thieves there began to accumulate wealth and at the same time started to talk about their ideals. Soon after, the protracted infighting began, where suspicion and betrayal were expressed by and against one another. The flames of the war fought between the dictator and their detractors eventually spread from the underground tunnel to the surface-level desert grounds...<br><br>This exposed wire was even older. It was dug out of a pothole by the bandits and then connected to a revamped overland vehicle with air leaking in from all directions, which was driven to a distant water source.<br><br>The top priority for all survivors of the war of betrayal was to locate Talia's water sources. They drove thousands of miles a day on deserts littered with glass shards in extremely shabby and poorly made vehicles. The caravans of the bandits sometimes chased each other, raising dust and heavy smoke, and other times they just wantonly threw people on or off the car... The sheer pressure of survival forced them to give up all other thoughts. Only by forging ahead could they be saved from confusion.<br><br>This naked wire was always old. It was further removed from the overland vehicle and placed into the town's lightbox by the bandits. The aging wire caused the lights to flicker frequently.<br><br>It was an old gangster who claimed to be the \"police officer\" who founded the original Nailscrap Town. With his strongarm tactics and charisma, he managed to keep the junkyard in good order. The town became livelier than ever. Eccentric engineers accidentally made machinery out of waste, and desperate wastelanders also enjoyed fighting back and forth in the underground arena... Late at night in a bar, they filled their glasses with grape juice that smelled like gasoline and cheered together, celebrating the fact that they had managed yet another day of survival.<br><br>There was nothing new in Talia, just old things repurposed differently in changing times.",

What was left of the whole Salsotto were the last two remaining cities that were moving non-stop, always running right after the terminator line.<br><br>The colossal fortress was floating in the air like a gargantuan raincloud, slowly hovering across the sky above the golden desert with thundering noise. Wherever it went, overwhelming storms of sand were cascading down and over. In the giant moving city, the Salsottians in winged suits were flying up and down among the city's buildings. These flying folks who had survived the calamity by sheer luck now belonged to the sky and were bound to it at the same time.<br><br>In the morning, skyfishers departed from the port and dove right for the sand, where they would hunt the phlogiston jellyfish. They would only return to the city after dusk. By the power of mysterious creatures, the city barely managed to voyage ahead.<br><br>Even though their entire survival relied squarely on those two fragile wings, the Salsottians were optimistic by nature and would never let the heavy burden of fate lower their spirit or bend their spine. They would find time to spend with their family playing glass musical instruments, with such an attitude that it was almost as if they could carve the musical notes right into the glass. They also enjoyed making pen pals and would often place their written messages in the Dandelion Letterbox, meant for the moving city on the other end of the terminator line.<br><br>Gradually, the planet's magnetic field weakened and the atmosphere thinned.

The line of dawn and dusk swept across the earth, climbed over mountains and ravines, brought dawn to those still awake, and sent sunset to those who would soon sleep... But when the rhythm of light and darkness slowed down, day and night were no longer familiar, and the seemingly eternal heat and coldness were like the quagmire of hell, slowly burying all lives entrapped within. This was why the Salsottian people, barely surviving at the time, boarded the floating mobile city and began their chase with dawn and dusk.<br><br>Climbing atop the observation deck of the mobile city of Tumbleweed and looking in the direction that they were moving, daylight lies ahead and dark night behind.<br><br>The pursuit of \"Tumbleweed\" is not only for survival but also for a dignified life. When it moved faster than the terminator line, then the early morning light would march into the afternoon; when slower than the terminator line, then the dusk light would fade into the late night. In this way, the naturally optimistic Salsottian managed to restore every day to its original state. The romance in their bloodline blessed them with the easygoing spirit to sing leisurely in peaceful afternoons and sleep soundly on starry nights.<br><br>However, this voyage of tenacity and perseverance would, at last, come to its final downfall, and the ruins of the once mobile city were eventually left far behind by the ever-shifting terminator line.<br><br>Years later, the two moving cities that had never met each other would finally stand against each other, with their respective turrets among the wreckage still aimed in opposition. One of the two cities must have crossed half of the planet to the other one and started the initial incursion. Traces of brutal warfare between the two cities were still occasionally discernible under the sand dunes, which merged with unnameable hatred and morphed together into the same ruins.<br><br>Planet Salsotto kept its silence.

According to the scholars' hypothesis, this action is tantamount to cell division in carbon-based life. Thereafter, currents randomly output different potentials via the transistor structure naturally formed on the planetary surface, creating the most primitive program. The proud scholars argued that in this way, machines have \"thoughts\" that are comparable to carbon-based life.<br><br>A mechanic objected to this: How can carbon-based life, which has not even been able to understand the origin of their own beings, have the gall to spout such fallacies? As soon as the words came out, the academic world of the universe was shaken to the core. Mechanical life began to re-examine the arrogant \"carbon-based centrism\" and examine its own origin.<br><br>However, the Screwllumites on the Planet Screwllum had no choice but to pause their march — their planet's energy was being exhausted faster than their inspiration circuits. They needed to first find a way for their population to survive.<br><br>In the end, they decided to carry out an extreme plan that transcended several Amber Eras: They used the dying planet as fuel to power the Celestial Differentiator. The awe-inspiring, gigantic gear tirelessly processed the punched tape, methodically repeating calculations. With its planetary energy supply, the huge machine simulated a bona fide and stable superecosystem. They would then build their new home around this parent star.<br><br>With their planetary crisis lifted, the Screwllumites could rest. Always rational, optimistic, and elegant, they are determined to explore the answer to their origins in a purely rational manner.<br><br>The massive system is filled with the sound of bearings grinding against each other, and the dense teeth of cogs drive the punched tape to churn out data. One branch flows into multiple branches, and countless branches guide trillions of gears to roar... Then, these branches collapse again and again, falling into the furnace and returning to silence in the bubbling core. Over a long period of time, the programmed super-ecosystem gradually became a wonderful and relatively stable one. Eventually, speculations about the origins of machines began to cause Screwllumites' imaginations to wander.<br><br>The steel construct that drives the dying star once again activated their intelligent thought circuits.

He had seen the despairingly absurd nature of this planetary system: An elegant string of state transient equations, a giant, icy cylinder — that's all Planet Screwllum is, nothing more.<br><br>According to his interpretation of the equations, at the birth of the Celestial Differentiator, its lead creator tried to explain the origin of the universe as a cellular automaton and its recursion, and Planet Screwllum itself was a result of the game of life.<br><br>Screwllumites and other inorganic life on the planet acted as the \"cells\" in this automaton, while also being smaller-scale cellular automatons. Automatons were always made up of many smaller automatons, going back to the smallest components that form the building blocks of the universe. What was the smallest component? No one knows. Neither Screwllum nor the scholar who first proposed building the Celestial Differentiator do.<br><br>That was why Screwllum felt empty.<br><br>Did that scholar's attempt fail? But the Celestial Differentiator had worked tirelessly for many Amber Eras. Did that not mean that the origin of the Screwllumites, their parent star, and even the entire universe can be attributed to that elegant string of equations? Not really. Until the super-ecosystem collapsed entirely, the equations remained unfalsifiable.<br><br>He swirled the fine glass of machine oil, never taking his eyes off the ring that recorded the truth of the planet. The giant screen-like perforated belt was tireless, and the rectangular array filtered the late-night moonlight. Screwllum couldn't stop thinking. <i>Do ends to recursions really exist?</i> He thought. <i>What is the nature of inorganic life — or yet, what is the origin of the universe?</i><br><br><i>Am I really willing to be only a witness to the ideas of my predecessors?</i><br><br>\"No,\" Screwllum concluded.

Those who claimed to have received the oracle of the god began to act, wishing to help the Aeon Qlipoth to build the wall.<br><br>The universe is in imminent peril, and the building of the wall cannot wait. The puny humans had no intention of imitating the feats of the god, instead gathering into a self-proclaimed \"support team\" for the Aeon, willing to devote everything to the Amber Lord. With the power of Preservation, the support team piloted their fleet to different stellar systems to purchase building materials such as stone, wood, gold, and supernium, then tirelessly transported these to the subspace barrier, piling the items on the planetary wasteland.<br><br>After the end of the short development period, the support team took a firm foothold in Pier Point and established the Interastral Peace Corporation. In order to fully carry out their devotion, they turned their sights to deep space.<br><br>Louis Fleming raised a call for action, and the long-distance trade fleet left the star systems adjacent to Aeon Qlipoth. Their commodities were no longer limited to building materials... They plan to connect the whole Cosmos and trade everything. Soon after, Dongfang Qixing implemented Cosmos-wide trade regulations and built a \"credit\" system to set a price for everything across the universe. Trillions of assets gathered under their megastructure on Pier Point. Like a silent black hole, the building destroyed people's notions about the limits of wealth.<br><br>Today, the ships of the Interastral Peace Corporation are all over the cosmos. Despite being criticized as a corporate dictatorship, the IPC has not stopped expanding. They don't care what other people think and have never forgotten their founding mission.<br><br>The IPC's recruit training methods change with each passing day, but after nearly eight hundred Amber Eras, there is only one historical practice that never changed. Once upon a time, Louis Fleming, the founder of the IPC, stood in front of the support team and made a passionate speech. He put forward the aspiration of uniting the universe and supporting the Aeon's wishes to protect the universe. As soon as the speech ended, the distant and huge sound of a cosmic impact sounded, injecting a lofty calling into this solemn and sublime moment. From that moment on, they knew this would become their unswerving belief.<br><br>\"All in the name of the Amber Lord.\"",

The support team prepared an adequate fleet, rare and precious goods, and offers that were hard to refuse, thus creating countless trades across star systems. Then, the support team controlled trade route and business information, held exclusive bargaining rights, and spearheaded the formulation of the cosmos's trade regulations.<br><br>Fleets full of wood, stone, rebar, and supernium passed by Aeon Qlipoth like a swarm of circling flies. The Amber Lord kept silent, never once casting their gaze upon the humans.<br><br>Eventually, times changed and trade with neighboring star systems was no longer sufficient for the bustling support team. The two wise ones were determined to delve deeper into the cosmos, and thus the Interastral Peace Corporation was born. The IPC offered anything a planet could ever want, at fair prices pegged to their \"credits.\" Since then, the cosmos's trade route was founded, and all planets that join the IPC's business network can share the same currency, buy the same goods, and enjoy the same services.<br><br>Merchant ships under the credit system travel between the stars, and the trade routes merge and separate to weave a pan-cosmic network. The ships full of treasures from distant stars passed the Aeon Qlipoth countless times like fireflies, and yet the Aeon remained as silent as before.<br><br>The building materials accumulated since the time of the support team piled up on every planet around the Aeon Qlipoth, and the amount will only increase. The Aeon Qlipoth has no intention of accepting these eager gifts, instead always solely focused on the crisis that will befall the unsuspecting mortals, having to cast the gargantuan barriers measured in light years. The small organization that used to purchase materials has long since become a tremendous influence in the cosmos. They gaze upon the headless colossus, never once feeling that their efforts were in vain.<br><br>\"All the toil and growth of our capital is for Qlipoth, and to execute the Aeon's will when the time comes.\"",

Skiffs went to and fro through the Jade Gate just like the celestial movements of stars and moons.

In this lonely voyage, people slumbered, woke up, and slumbered again in incessant alternation... Star-chasing whales fell from the dome of heaven, and crystalline entities made of subgrain lattice managed to span light years without a single crack. The Elixir Seekers witnessed the majesty of various supernatural powers. In covert delight, they further hardened their resolve to obtain immortality.<br><br>After voyaging for thousands of years, the Xianzhou Luofu gradually came to a halt, whereupon it encountered the master of Abundance in the limbo between the reality and the imaginary. Yaoshi bestowed a divine miracle upon the ship, and it immediately manifested as the Ambrosial Arbor. Its shade was as large as clouds, blocking out the sky and sun. Its roots were thick and dense, enveloping the entire Xianzhou ship — the Luofu seemed to be brought to life.<br><br>Those who coveted immortality swallowed the fruit of the Ambrosial Arbor, and finally obtained the Endless Lifespan they had dreamed so much about. The Xianzhou residents began to claim they were celestial beings worthy of endless lifespans in abundance, and they also learned to use the Ambrosial Arbor to create various inhuman marvels via the blessings of immortality.<br><br>Yet, just like the shifting of the sun and moon, what once prospered was fated to decline and what once brought elation must eventually induce agony. It was not until the arrival of the Three Sufferings, when people were tormented to near extinction, that the Xianzhou people finally came to understand the true nature of this so-called miracle, which was nothing but harrowing calamity.<br><br>In the midst of disaster, a hero rose with the Reignbow and split the Ambrosial Arbor in half. The Xianzhou people regained their dignity as humans, and vowed to return to mortality and purge all deathless doom in this universe. In the ensuing years, Xianzhou went on a hunt across the stellar seas, taking it upon themselves to purge all deathless abominations. The Foxians regained their freedom and took back control of the sky, while the Vidyadhara sealed off the contamination and any residual catastrophes. The three races were then brought together in a covenant and coalition. Thus was born the Xianzhou Alliance.<br><br>Prosperity and calamity came and went in cycles during the voyage. Heroes and legends rose to fame and glory one after another as history marched on. Now, the Xianzhou Luofu is healing and reconstructing in a period of hard-won peace. Free trade and open minds truly brought it back to life.<br><br>Immortality had permanently molded the Xianzhou Luofu. With its ups and downs through history, the Xianzhou Luofu accumulated its own unique aura that combined both antiquity and modernity. It would only take any traveling merchant mere seconds to feel the marks left by the passage of time on this ark.",

From that moment, the ancient taboos and laws were rendered useless, and nature's dictum and ethics regarding aging and death became irrelevant history. People followed the way of immortality to exploit the Ambrosial Arbor with increasing intensity, making Fallow Earth that never exhausted itself, molding their own bodies to shapeshift, and giving the gift of thinking and talking to animals... Innumerable unimaginable technologies were brought into existence under the branches of the Ambrosial Arbor.<br><br>However, the Ambrosial Arbor took off its disguise as time went by, revealing its hideous visage as the agony of immortality crept upon the immortals.<br><br>The celestials ceaselessly reproduced, yet tasted no death. The ship groaned from overpopulation, as hunger and starvation tormented many. Xianzhou's young can never realize their life's ambitions while their elders clang to power, and society teetered at the edge of structural collapse... Rebellions of the aurumatons and external invasions marked a ruinous millennium, after which the darkness hidden in immortal bloodlines also showed its face. The so-called \"Body of Celestials\" was simply a technology that surpassed human intellect. The propensity to be stricken with mara was a warning to all Xianzhou natives, a reminder that they were a mere step away from becoming abominations themselves.<br><br>In desperation, a hero tore through the sky with a powerful shot from their bow, splitting the Ambrosial Arbor in half... Yet even if all there was left of the Ambrosial Arbor was a burnt stump, the fate of Xianzhou could never be separated from it.<br><br>It attracted external forces to invade Xianzhou. The Abominations of Abundance launched multitudes of assaults, where flesh was distorted and blood was spilled, for the sole purpose of devouring Xianzhou whole. The Arbor also tempted the Xianzhou residents. The Disciples of Sanctus Medicus broke the taboos and ventured deep into the secret of Abundance within the Ambrosial Arbor, hoping to reforge the once mighty immortal empire... In the long days of foreign and domestic troubles, the remaining corpus of the Ambrosial Arbor lurked like unending vines propagating in the shadows, waiting for an opportunity to wreak havoc again.<br><br>Fortunately, the Xianzhou Luofu never lowered its guard against the withered tree. The people had vowed to cast this source of all distortions into the end of all things.",

Countless in quantity, they were difficult to store, and she couldn't be bothered to manage them herself.<br><br>The generous and charitable Interastral Peace Corporation then proposed a solution and that was how the Herta Space Station, where wisdom and secrets are stored, was born. Comprehensive containment measures were made throughout the space station, all in the pursuit of organizing everything in the collection with order and clarity. Phenomena were stored in specialized containers while Curios were regulated in indices. Innumerable items were categorized and classified, then stored deep within the station for research.<br><br>The IPC then proposed a collaboration in exploring the secrets of the stars together, which brought curious and adventurous scholars into the station to conduct research.<br><br>Most of them admired Madam Herta, vowing to never abandon their ethereal aspirations and explore the secrets whispered among the stars. They investigated the star systems and realms of living beings, debated true justice in discourses on ethics and philosophies, outlined valleys and peaks within galaxies, deciphered secrets behind religious rituals and ceremonies, held on to the way of seeking truth from practice... They were the true believers of passing knowledge to posterity, and practiced unrestrained and divergent research.<br><br>However, once the space station moved into orbit, it started to operate on its own and Madam Herta rarely showed herself. It was then that the IPC realized the whole station was filled with the mundane daily activities of the researchers, yet the genius was nowhere to be seen.<br><br>Light from different zones rendered people unaware of the passage of time, the traces of which could only be detected in the burnt out lifestyle in the station. Often a smattering of researchers would argue non-stop about a particular piece of collection, even going so far as to start a fight. Occasionally a security officer would be absent from their daily patrol and nap instead on their military-styled bunker. Sometimes senior researchers would share with their younger peers tales of past romances, while some big shots would disguise themselves as temporary workers to bid their time for the next big turn of luck... Besides research, there was also life. They just had to look outside the hull — for the stars were journeying with them.<br><br>Despite all the limitations, the researchers still talked about the everyday life in the space station in their own romantic way — The cosmos was a profound epic poem, and Herta Space Station was slowly cracking open the poetry collection.",

Relying on the security personnel hired by the IPC and a somewhat advanced defensive system proved insufficient to handle the hostility from the stars...

Madam Herta collected them all when she was in the mood, but would often lose interest once she got her hands on them.<br><br>Hence, though the space station appears to be floating peacefully in space, its treasure hoard of multi-shaped crises hung above it like a sword waiting to fall.<br><br>Senior researchers had long been aware of the dangers they faced, and understood that \"secrets lie deep within danger.\" They strictly adhere to confidentiality agreements and faithfully carry out regulated containment procedures, thus burying danger within an outward silence... In the cafeteria, they were friends who could joke around. Yet, deep in the bowels of the space station's storage zones, they were highly skilled experts. In this place, secrets would always remain secrets.<br><br>The space station is operating as usual in low orbit around The Blue.
