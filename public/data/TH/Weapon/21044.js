Welcome to Remembrance's stage. At this distance... you're more enchanting than you seem.\"</i><br><br>The surroundings gradually grow dark. A shaft of light pours down from above, following the ever-shifting choreography of the two.<br><i>\"There are some people who should be dancing with us right now, however, they never arrived...\"</i><br><br>In the brief moment of a spin, she approaches that impassive face and grasps those ice-cold hands, and softly asks — <br><i>\"Tell me. What have you done?\"</i><br><br>As the dance steps grow more hurried, the broken fragments of the past rush into her brain through their joined fingertips.<br>In a history that stretches back further and further, she hears the sound of rain and the lament of lives before death. Then, she sees her dance partner before her, and how that person is holding a blood-red paper umbrella under the drizzling rain. Finally, as far as her eyes can see —<br><br>Countless corpses of the drowned are bobbing up and down in a torrential flood.<br><br>Panicking, she tries to withdraw her hand and falls backwards.<br>The surroundings grow bright again, and the hubbub of the party re-surfaces. Her dance partner softly holds her waist, as if completely oblivious to what just happened.<br><i>\"What a lovely dance that was, Memokeeper. Would you like another one?\"</i>"
