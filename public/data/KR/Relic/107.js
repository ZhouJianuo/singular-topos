            "Story": "To the Firesmith clan, crafting unparalleled weapons is both their talent's calling and a lifelong curse.<br><br>Ever since the arrival of the liberated Firesmith Clan in the world of Warforge, their skills bloomed to the extremes while also becoming tainted with the aura of Destruction.<br><br>The dazzling light of the furnace, the sparks of metal clashing, and the long-lasting forging process can turn raw ore into a fine weapon, but can also gradually strip the firesmith of their eyesight. One day, at the bottom of a volcano, Foy found a deposit of rare obsidian flame crystal. From this, he carefully polished a pair of protective goggles, which transformed the fierce sparks of fire into pale-white silhouettes. However, the greedy smith was unable to fully escape his cursed fate either, burning everything he was into cinders in the ultimate fire.<br><br>Foy deemed the Antimatter Legion in the Warforge as the raw materials for his creations, and himself as the rising flame.<br><br>\"I wonder... is it possible to harness the power of a thermonuclear reaction in my furnace?\" Foy's pursuit of the ultimate fire came to an unfruitful end in an out-of-control thermonuclear fusion.",

As one pursues a purer creation, one must also pursue a more extreme temperature.<br><br>Creatures of the Legion crave for separation from the material existence, longing for the fundamental mutations that can only be brought forth by the scorching heat waves of Destruction.<br><br>A highly-skilled master Firesmith can raise the forge's temperature to unbelievable levels — the flame's black-body radiation would exhibit the blue spectrum like that of a dying star. Firesmiths are also geniuses at controlling flames, but only the best among them are bestowed with a ring of flame-mastery as a mark of their superb skill.<br><br>The Warforge had long ceased to differentiate between the smith and the smithed. All those Firesmith masters who had been smelting the Antimatter Creatures had also become parts of the Weapons of Destruction<br><br>\"The smelting depends on the temperature, and the temperature depends on the Firesmith.\" This is matter-of-fact knowledge to any Firesmith who can control the art of Destruction.",

Neither the bubbling of toxic gases nor the gurgling of magma could interrupt Surtur's concentration at the forge. Though burning waves of molten rock would splash on Surtur's fireproof apron of giant firelizard skin, the leather never lost its luster when the flames faded.<br><br>A massive proportion of the Legion's fighting forces were repeatedly hammered and smelted in the forge until their flesh and weaponry were fused together under the hammers of the Firesmiths, becoming weapons of Destruction.<br><br>\"This incomparable power of destruction...\" The Firesmiths who control the flames have never hidden the terrible aspirations they place in their weapons.",

The chief poured in all his resentment and humiliation into the forge and would never be tired, not even by days of non-stop hammering. Upon one hammering after another, the once stubborn and proud antimatter creatures had to eventually change their form and give in to the remolding by the Destroyer.<br><br>Despite being free from any tangible cages, the Firesmiths' obsession with forging had become another form of prison for them, had it not?<br><br>\"Flesh and blood are a burden.
