        "Desc": "Artificed Dancers developed by the Fontaine Research Institute.\nBossuet originally intended for Artificed Dancers to be works of art that transcended the era of mechanical reproduction. But after Bossuet was forced to resign, the project was taken over by Maillardet, who had his own unique understanding of what he wanted to achieve. As a result, while their features were perfected during the course of its development, the Artificed Dancers gradually strayed from Bossuet's original vision.\n\nNext up is a fantastical performance to be delivered by the clockwork meka Geppelia. \nAt the climax of the performance, Geppelia will halt at the center of the dance floor and expose her spare clockwork component charged with Ousia, thereby drastically increasing the efficiency of her exertions and summoning countless whirlwinds of dirge. \nDuring this phase, using Pneuma-imbued attacks will reduce her offensive capabilities and overload her, thus progressing the performance.",

Even if all seven nations were to be swallowed by the deeps, the elegant Court of Fontaine would float above it all, just like Celestia. Even the secrets of the universe would no longer seem so distant.\nThe Arkhium in the device's core has the characteristics of \"splitting\" or \"precipitation,\" and can take matter, or certain things outside of matter, and separate them.

This branch of their genus was able to survive by adapting more toward earth-based living, and became known as the \"Wenut.\"\nSome desert folk still mistakenly believe that Wenut is the final point of a quicksand eel's life cycle, likely due to superficial similarities between the species' behaviors.",

Although this contradicts another theory regarding the origin of Xuanwen Beasts, the few records of the suanni often show them attended by a large number of Xuanwen Beasts.\nThese days, the well-known Wushou Dance in Chenyu Vale came from the movements of the suanni. But since only a handful of people have actually seen such creatures, most can only imagine what they look like. After thousands of years of changes and different artistic interpretations, the Wushou Dance costume head has developed into its current style.",

Everything, from cities to history, will eventually be razed to sand grains by the winnowing currents that drift over the Great Red Sand. Only creatures such as the flying serpents, which have learned to live with the wind, can continue to survive in the desert long after all has been reduced to dust.",
