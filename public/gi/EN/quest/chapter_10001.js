On that night, everyone in Liyue releases Xiao Lanterns and Mingxiao Lanterns into the bright night sky. Within each of the xiao lanterns, placed a natural levitation stone, and on it hung one's wishful prayer, or a painting depicting one's desire. The lanterns slowly fly away while carrying a hope that the lights emitted by the lanterns might guide the soul of once Liyue's faithful protector, to return and reunite once more. You and Paimon have arrived at this solemn moment of Liyue, preparing for your five-days-long journey...",
