        "Step": "After arriving on Seirai island, you meet two adventurers who are currently investigating something known as a Warding Stone. But following the footprints of a cat, you arrive at a dilapidated shrine, in which sits a cat named \"Neko,\" who proclaims itself to be the \"provisional head priestess of the Asase Shrine.\" After you help \"Neko\" repair the shrine's Offering Box, it reveals the method of activating the Warding Stones to you. Additionally, you learn that should you be able to seal all four Warding Stones throughout Seirai Island, you can calm the thunderstorm that enshrouds it.",
