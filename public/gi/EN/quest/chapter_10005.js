It seems this whole thing is not as serious as you originally thought. The Treasure Thieves in Liyue just received an anonymous letter. Out of fear and respect for Xiao, the Treasure Thieves gave the letter to you. The sender requested that someone of high rank from the Treasure Thieves meet with them secretly in Liyue to discuss an important matter. Once again, out of fear and respect for Xiao, they agreed to let you play as a high ranking official of the Treasure Thieves and meet the mysterious sender.",
